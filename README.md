##     <p align = "left"> Introduction üìö </p>

This project is a web application that perform object detection on images. It marks the objects location with bounding boxes along with the object label and confidence level. 
YOLOv3 is used in this model for detecting objects. It can detect 80 different objects. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm which can detect multiple 
objects present in the image in real-time.
<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Features ‚≠ê </p>
 -  Real-time detection of different objects.
 -  Utilizes the powerful YOLOv3 model for object detection.

##     <p align = "left"> Installation and Usage üõ†Ô∏è </p>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 
3. Position your computer in front of the couch. It's preferable if the computer's camera is parallel to the couch.
4. Set up a Telegram bot
Update the telegram_key and chat_id variables in the code with your bot's API key and your chat ID.
5. Run the script 'python detector.py'
6. The tool will then use your computer's camera to monitor the couch.
7. The tool has been programmed to specifically detect dogs, cats, sofas, and beds while ignoring other objects.

##     <p align = "left"> Acknowledgements </p>
I'd like to express my gratitude to the creators of the YOLOv3 model, as their work served as the foundation for this project.
