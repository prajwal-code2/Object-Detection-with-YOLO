##     <p align = "left"> Introduction 📚 </p>

This project is a web application that perform object detection on images. It marks the objects location with bounding boxes along with the object label and confidence level. 
YOLOv3 is used in this model for detecting objects. It can detect 80 different objects. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm which can detect multiple 
objects present in the image in real-time.
<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Features ⭐ </p>
 -  Real-time detection of different objects.
 -  Utilizes the powerful YOLOv3 model for object detection.
